<h3>Too Long; Didn't Read</h3>
My name is Joe, I'm a Rails Dev from the UK with 2 years of experience looking for a new role based in Berlin.

<h3 align="left">Who I am</h3>
As a person, I am kind, sensitive and value-driven and I am happiest in a work environment that is likewise conscientious about its role in the world. I'm an honest and articulate communicator and I care deeply about justice and ethics, both inside and outside of my workplace â€” a standard I keep for myself, first of all.
<br/><br/>
As a programmer, I take enormous satisfaction from writing good code that is future-proof, human-readable, reusable and logical. These are the criteria I have in mind every time I sit down to work. I believe the role of the developer is as much about documenting the codebase, designing its structure and communicating clearly and productively with all those involved.
<br/><br/>
Aside from my career, I'm also an amateur creator of music, film and literature. I love language-learning, and speak French, Spanish and German to an intermediate level. I read incessantly, on a million different topics, I like travelling and hiking for getting some headspace, and since 2021 I have been living in Leipzig, Germany.

<h3 align="left">Experience</h3>

<p>
  My main body of experience as a developer is the two years I spent as a Full Stack Developer in the Digital Transformation team at @unepwcmc. I came into that job as a well-trained, unseasoned programmer who knew the basics of the web. By the time I left the organisation, I had first-hand experience of massive web applications used by environmental scientists across the world.

  I'm really proud of the growth I underwent in this period. I led the development of brand new projects, successfully realising our team's designs on time. I devised solutions to meet specific requirements for our projects, leading the development of features like multisite Single-Sign-On and Sharepoint integration. I worked to foster best practices among the dev team to ensure our work was cohesive and efficient, making significant contributions to our in-house gems. The value I provided to the team is 

  Previous to this, I also spent a year studying Web Development with @microverse. There I did the essential learning of a Full Stack Developer, building personal projects to demonstrate competency in Rails, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML & CSS and React, as well as cultivating my soft skills and professionalism.
